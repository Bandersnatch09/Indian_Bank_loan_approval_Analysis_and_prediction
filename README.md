# Indian_Bank_loan_approval_Analysis_and_prediction
## Business understanding.
The goal of the loan approval project is to create a prediction model that can accurately determine an applicant's potential of receiving a loan through taking into consideration both their personal and financial features. This method enhances and automates decision-making through utilising machine learning algorithms and historical data. The project's stakeholder, State Bank of India, will benefit from the model's ability to analyse patterns and trends in the data to produce credible suggestions, which will save time and money on manual evaluations and increase the consistency of loan embrace decisions.

### Overview

### problem statement
By developing a predictive model that accurately evaluates applicants' likelihood of loan approval, an Indian bank hopes to improve its loan approval procedure in light of advances in technology and escalating competition. Making the transition to data-driven solutions from manual evaluations will result in more rapid and precise decision-making. In order to find trends and forecast approval outcomes, this model will make use of previous customer data. The main task is to develop a model that maintains ethical lending practices, conforms with regulations, and yields high accuracy.

### Objectives
* To create a machine learning model that can accurately predict the likelihood of loan approval for applicants
* To use insights from the Model to automate the loan approval system based on the best features
* To get the predictive model's accuracy score up to 80% in order to produce accurate forecasts that support decision-making.

## Data Understanding

We will use the Loan Approval Dataset that we obtained through Kaggle for this project.
The dataset's columns are as follows: The rows each reflect an Indian loan applicant.

* Id: A special number assigned to every loan application.

* Income: The applicant's level of income.

* Age: The applicant's age.

* Years of experience working in a professional capacity.

* Married/Single: The applicant's marital status.

* House_Ownership: This field indicates if the candidate is a home owner or renter.

* Car_Ownership: This field indicates if the applicant is a car owner.

## Next Steps
The XGBoost model is the best to implement because it had the highest accuracy score and was correct 90% of the time when it predicted a risky outcome.

* Identify and develop new features to improve the model's prediction power.

* Ensure that the model complies with applicable legislation and ethical principles, notably those governing fair lending practices.

* Set up monitoring to track the model's performance over time. Implement a maintenance schedule for regular updates and retraining.

## Recommendations

* Use the XGboost clasifier model as it is the most effective to use for an automatic loan approval system 

* Provide training for stakeholders with the knowledge to effectively use and understand the model and implement a feedback mechanism to improve the model continuously

* Explore the use of advanced machine learning techniques like deep learning to further improve model accuracy and continuously explore new features that can improve the predictive power of the model.

* Continuously monitor model performance after deployment by constantly tracking performanceand Plan for regular updates and retraining with new data to maintain accuracy and relevance.

* Conduct fairness analysis to prevent bias and discrimination against any group and to ensure the model complies with relevant regulations
